# Computation practicum

## Description

#### In this task we have such subproblems:
1. 
2. 
3. 


1. Euler’s method, improved Euler’s method and Runge-Kutta method should be implemented in the application with corresponded GUI, that allows user to change x0 , y0 , X, N and plot the graphs of exact and numerical solutions.
2. Also the graph of local errors for each method also should be plotted.
3. Results should be incorporated to the final report.
4. Implementation should obey to OOP-design standards, in particular, the code should be organized within SOLID principles (especially within single responsibility principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle).
5. Report should contain UML-diagram of classes and the most interesting parts of source code.


## SOLID principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle

Python doesn't have interfaces because it has late binding/duck typing which is strictly more powerful at the cost of being less type-safe, and it can use abstract base classes (implemented using metaclasses) with multiple inheritance if you want to enforce that all instances of a class implements a set of methods.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle
